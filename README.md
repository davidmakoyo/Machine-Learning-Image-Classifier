# Machine Learning Image Classifier

This project is a web application that allows users to upload images and classify them using a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model on the CIFAR-10 dataset. The application is built using Streamlit, Keras, and various other Python libraries. It provides an easy-to-use interface for uploading images, making predictions, and visualizing the model's confidence in its predictions.

## Features

- Upload images in JPG, JPEG, or PNG format.
- Classify images into one of the available categories
- Display the uploaded image.
- Display a bar chart of the model's prediction confidence for each category.
